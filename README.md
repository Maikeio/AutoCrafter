# AutoCrafter
A Minecraft spigot server plugin that adds an AutoCrafter to the game.
If you want to try it out, just download the AutoCrafter.jar from the latest version [here](https://github.com/Maikeio/ElytraAutoEquipper/releases)
and add it to your plugin folder.
If you want to have AutoCrafter make something for you, just create an upgrade module and put it in a dropper.
After you put the upgrade module in the dropper, you need to set what you want the autocrafter to make.
To do that, you simply need to craft something in the new workbench menu and take the result from the workbench.
After that, if enough items come into the dropper through a hopper and there are enough items, it will automatically become
Your recipe.
